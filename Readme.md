# NextGram with Root Path Bug Reproduction

This is a fork of the NextGram app built as a demo for Instagram style routes in Next.js 13 with Parallel and Intercepting routes. 

The original has a `/` root page that shows the grid of photos and then individual `/photos/:id` pages. However, for my use case, I would like to have the individual pages be at `/:id` without the `/photos` route segment. This is not currently possible as of Next.js 13.5.5. I have recorded two videos below showing the correct and incorrect behavior (you can see the URL changes in the Arc browser below).

# Try it Yourself
I have also gone through and deployed this app to Vercel and updated the below instructions for this repo so you can see the issues for yourself.
